    <p>
        Hot damn, these are some delicious looking churros.
        <b><em>Clearly</em></b>, these churros represent a significant
        departure from the kind of work we've seen before in Churros 1.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
        <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
        
    </ol>
