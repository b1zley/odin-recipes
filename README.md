Hello!
This project intends to demonstrate the (somewhat limited)
html skills and understanding I have developed thus far
through The Odin Project.

It should follow the base guidelines of the exercise 
to produce a website of recipes, in a somewhat brutalist
design.

It should have different types of text, imbedded links, and
images.

It should also demonstrate good file layout practice as
discussed in the course.

Thank you for checking this out!
